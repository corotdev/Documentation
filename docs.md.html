In-script headers
---
Unfortunately, you cannot use markdown inside of script files.
As an alternative, in large script files, to create "headers" which are useful for anchoring and finding where the function starts or ends, do this: 
(Big: //7 lines
https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Modular&t=Input
Medium: //5 lines
https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=ANSI%20Regular&t=Input
Small: //3 lines
https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Calvin%20S&t=Input
)
These are specifically to be used for the start of important functions in long files so that they can be easily located by scrolling and scanning. Please add them wherever it makes sense to do so.

Shared state
---
To reduce the complexity caused by modular exports, all scripts use a shared state. This is extremely beneficial because it makes reusing variables between files easy as breathing, and removes some message-passing overhead, but it has a __very important implication__: 
<br>Any variable declared anywhere, no matter how temporary or unimportant, is accessible for all files by default, which WILL cause name collisions, which are NOT picked up by the Lua compiler (Yes, Lua is compiled. It is compiled by an interpreter to bytecode. Don't believe the fools online who say otherwise). This makes it __absolutely mandatory__ to declare all vars "local" unless they are necessary for access elsewhere/everywhere/publicly and never use generalized public varnames, try to keep those vars as specific as possible, and prefix each public varname with _filename_ where filename is the name of the Lua file it is declared in to avoid varname clashes thanks :) (these are also good standards to write usable code in general)

-tabs
-no alignment
-use distance field fonts instead of bitmap (change materials too from default to "-df.material" version)
-keep main.collection empty besides loading other collections
-name all children of game objects which aren't game objects and are the only one of the type that type itself
-for testing or experimenting, never pollute the real collections, keep all that solely to test.collection and switch the game.project Main Collection to test.collection for those purposes
-always set all GUI nodes to Adjust mode: Zoom in properties panel

For rendering, we use defold-orthographic by default. This is only valid for 2d games. Docs here https://github.com/britzl/defold-orthographic

For UI extension and localization, we use Druid. Docs here: https://github.com/Insality/druid
For JSON, we use an extension which does not work on linux: https://github.com/Melsoft-Games/defold-cjson
For OS info and features, we use Defos. Docs: https://github.com/subsoap/defos/releases

For Achievements, Friends, Matchmaking etc on Steam, we use Steamworks. For projects without need for Steam features, remove it. Docs: https://github.com/britzl/steamworks-defold

For allowing the user to share data to someone else (for example telling them about the game), we use the defold native share plugin docs https://github.com/britzl/defold-sharing

For loading images from file to buffer, try https://github.com/Lerg/extension-imageloader, although it may be broken

For clipboard functions, accessing copy/paste, we use https://github.com/britzl/defold-clipboard/

For Discord Rich Presence, we use https://github.com/subsoap/discordrich which uses snake_case variant of https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to#updating-presence-update-presence-payload-fields

For table operations we use https://github.com/BobG1983/DefTable

For a simple timer for speed running or countdowns, use https://github.com/klaytonkowalski/defold-timer

For when a dynamic map or projection such as space powerplay map is necessary, use the NOT YET IMPLEMENTED https://github.com/JCash/defold-voronoi

For QR code logins, use https://github.com/defold/extension-qrcode/

For complex styled text, use https://github.com/britzl/defold-richtext

If 2d game is vector instead of pixel, in game.project change all "subpixels" options to checked and make the rendering method "linear" instead of "nearest"
If game is 3d then remove refold-orthographic and instead add scene3d, Operator, Defold-illumination, Kinematic Walker, and TrenchBroom
https://github.com/indiesoftby/defold-scene3d (3d primitives as .buffer, Frustum culling, helper 3d math functions, skybox)
https://github.com/indiesoftby/defold-scene3d/tree/main/scene3d/assets/meshes
https://github.com/astrochili/defold-operator ()
https://github.com/astrochili/defold-illumination (3d vox, fog, ambient lighting, directional lighting)
https://github.com/astrochili/defold-kinematic-walker
https://github.com/astrochili/defold-trenchbroom
Needed table modification funcs that don't exist natively, use https://github.com/BobG1983/DefTable
Needed string modification funcs that don't exist natively, use https://github.com/subsoap/defstring
An .ogg sound file that needs to be played, use resource.load(abc.ogg) as you would with a wav and run `decodeogg.decodeogg(res)` where res is the name of the variable the resource was loaded to

Extra deets:



Add Discord Rich Presence with:
1. Make app at https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Obtain discord_client_id which will look like "8674960145089348561"
3. Add to config.script "discordrich.initialize(your_discord_client_id)"
4. Add the following code block wherever the content of the rich presence should be changed:
```lua
discordrich.update_presence({
  status = "My status",
  details = "Doing something important in-game",
})
```

Clipboard:
clipboard.copy(String text) 
clipboard.paste() --> returns string

Helpful Sharing:
share.text(String text)

JSON:
cjson.encode(lua_table)
cjson.decode(valid_json_string)

Helpful steamworks:
steamworks.user_stats_set_achievement (https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#SetAchievement)
